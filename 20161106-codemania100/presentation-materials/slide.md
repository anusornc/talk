<br>
So many ways to have FUN

* Travels
* Sports
* Games
* Music
* Movies
* Books
* ...

---

<br>
Even just software related

* Solve hard problem
* Earn a lot of money
* Build product that people love
* And so on ...

---

<br>
<br>
<br>
I just want to share one perspective of fun

with code

# Aspects of FUN

- Feedback & Interactivity
- Confident
- Powerful
- Front-end
- Innovation

---

# Clojure

<!-- * General purpose -->
* Functional language
* Mainly compile to JVM byte code and JavaScript
  * Hosted, embraces host language
* Data oriented

---

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```Clojure
(println "Hello," "World")
```

---

# Function
<br>

```Clojure
(defn say-hello [name]
  (println "Hello," name))
```

<br>

```Clojure
#(println "Hello," %)
```

---

# Data structures

```clojure

["Orange" "Apple" "Microsoft"]

{1 "Monday" 2 "Tuesday" 3 "Wednesday" 4 "Thursday"
 5 "Friday" "6" "Saturday" :7 "Sunday"}
```

```clojure
#{"Pen" "Apple" "Apple Pen"}
```

---

# Aspects of FUN

- _**Feedback & Interactivity**_
- Confident
- Powerful
- Front-end
- Innovation

---

# REPL

* Read, eval, print, loop
* Inherited from Lisp

---

# Aspects of FUN

- Feedback & Interactivity
- _**Confident**_
- Powerful
- Front-end
- Innovation

---

# Confident

* Immutable & Persistent data structure
  * Any operation on a data structure only efficiently creates a new one
  * No more defensive copy
  * Simple concurrency
* Small & stable core
  * Macro

---

# Example[^*]

<br>
<br>
<br>

```Clojure
(conj [0 1 2 3 4] 5)

```

[^*]: http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1

---

<br>

```Clojure
(get {:a 1 :b 2} :a)
(assoc {:a 1 :b 2} :c 3)
```
```Clojure
(get-in {:a {:b {:c {:d 5}}}} [:a :b :c :d])
(assoc-in {:a {:b {:c {:d 5}}}} [:a :b :c :d] 6)
```
```clojure
(update-in {:a {:b {:c {:d 5}}}} [:a :b :c :d] inc)
(update-in y [:a :b :c :d] #(+ % 1))
```

---

# Collection functions

<br>

```clojure
(group-by :name [{:name "David" :age 36}
                 {:name "Michael" :age 40}
                 {:name "David" :age 25}])
```

---

### Some data structures are also function

```clojure
(filter even? (range 20))

(#{3 8 6} 6)            (#{3 8 6} 5)

(filter #{3 8 6} (range 10))

(filter (comp #{3 8 6} :id)
        [{:id 2 :name "Adam"}
         {:id 3 :name "Albert"}
         {:id 4 :name "Alex"}])
```

---

Demo

---

# Macro

```java
Map charNumber = new HashMap();
charNumber.put("A", 1);
charNumber.put("B", 2);
charNumber.put("C", 3);
```

```Clojure
(doto (java.util.HashMap.)
    (.put "A" 1)
    (.put "B" 2)
    (.put "C" 3))
```

# Aspects of FUN

- Feedback & Interactivity
- Confident
- _**Powerful**_
- Front-end
- Innovation

---

# Powerful

* Concurrency
* Leverage power of host platform
  * All JVM and JS libraries available
* Extensibility

---

### Concurrency support with ease

* CRUD app handles by database
* Many primitives, but we don't have time so I pick the most important one
* Atom

---

## Atom

* Mutable reference to immutable data
* Get -> Calculate -> Check -> Set or Retry
* Fearless multithread programming

---

<br>

```clojure
(def a (atom {:x 1 :y 2}))
```

```clojure
@a
```

```clojure
(swap! a assoc :x 3)
```

---

Demo

---

## Extensibility

* core.async
  * Steal from Go
  * Implemented as a library
  * Macro

---

Demo

# Aspects of FUN

- Feedback & Interactivity
- Confident
- Powerful
- _**Front-end**_
- Innovation

---

## ClojureScript

* Compiles Clojure to JavaScript
* Should work with all the JS runtimes, more popular in browser
  * Node.js, React Native, Electron, Google Spreadsheet
* Uses Google Closure compiler / library
  * Behind Gmail
  * Dead code eliminations
  * Rich set of libraries
* Share code between backend and fronted
  * E.g. Same HTML template, Websocket router, Data synchornization
* Production level

# Aspects of FUN

- Feedback & Interactivity
- Confident
- Powerful
- Front-end
- _**Innovation**_

---

# Innovation

* Keep up latest great ideas
  * Go style CSP
  * React
* Stable core and backward compatibility in mind
  * Macro & Rich Hickey
* Keep up with future platforms
  * Hosted design

---

# Few last points

* Learn library not syntax
* Small community achieving big things
* One person can achieve more things
